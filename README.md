  <em>Tired of boring and plain QR codes?</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  Look no further! I am here to introduce you to a QR code website generator that is written in <strong>PHP</strong>, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/t0k4rt/phpqrcode">qrlib library</a>. With a <strong>user-friendly</strong> interface, creating QR codes for your website has never been easier. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customize</strong> the size, error correction level and make your QR codes stand out. To use this tool, you'll need to <strong>download and add the qrlib library</strong> to a new "libs" folder in your project. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Save and share</strong> your QR codes with friends, or use them to promote your business like a boss.

  <em>So why settle for a bland QR code when you can have one that's the <strong>life of the party</strong>?</em>
